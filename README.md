# Flat Earth Gravity Simulator

A simple Simulator for the magnitude of gravity for a uniform density disc (Flat Earth!).

## Results
Several different disc thicknesses are calculated, all relative to disc radius to eliminate units.

## Conclusions
Seems like Newtonian gravity would have to be incorrect for the earth to be flat (really!? What a surprising result!)
Flat earthers, learn some math and basic logic/reasoning skills please, this stuff was known hundreds of years ago dudes.
