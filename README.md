# Flat Earth Gravity Simulator

A simple Simulator for the magnitude of gravity on the surface of a uniform density disc (Flat Earth!).

## Results
Several different disc thicknesses are calculated, all relative to disc radius to eliminate units.

## Conclusions
Seems like Newtonian gravity would have to be incorrect for the earth to be flat (really!? What a surprising result!).
If you lived on a flat earth with Newtonian gravity and weighed 100 lbs at the center of the flat earth (wherever that is), you would only weigh around 95 lbs halfway between the center and the edge and about 55 lbs at the edge.
